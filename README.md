# Hello, I'm Abdulrahman Laoye!

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

_I'm currently working on a web development application in Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)_
  
_I'm currently learning full-stack web development in CoGrammar using the HyperionDev platform_
  
_I'm looking to collaborate on: 
   * Innovative Web-based VR and AR projects; projects that aim to seamlessly integrate AR and VR experiences across various devices, enhancing accessibility and user engagement;
    * Developing and enhancing tools that make VR/AR development more accessible to web developers; and 
    * Exploring the usability, effectiveness, or new applications of VR and AR in traffic engineering._
  
_I'm looking for help with advancing my skills in 3D modelling and immersive environment design for AR/VR applications, understanding best practices for optimizing VR/VR web applications for various devices, and
       learning more about user interface design in 3D spaces._
                             
_Ask me about tips and resources:
 * For beginners to kickstart their journey into full-stack web development;
 * Understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics, including how they work together to build dynamic; and
 * Interactive web applications; and getting started with Git and GitHub, including branching, merging, and collaborating on projects with others._
  
_How to reach me: Email me at **energyspur@gmail.com**, connect with me at **www.linkedin.com/in/abdulrahman-adewale-laoye-0bb28b105**, and follow me on GitHub to see my current projects and contributions._

**Fun fact: Did you know that Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, originally proposed the idea while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in 1989?
      He envisioned a system for sharing and accessing information over the internet, laying the foundation for what we now know as the modern web. Even with just a month into my full-stack journey,
      I am already part of a legacy of innovation that continues to shape the digital world today!**
